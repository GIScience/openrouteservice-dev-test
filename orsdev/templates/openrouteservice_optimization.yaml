#### CONFIGURATION ####
# - numeric parameter: as mapping with "min", "max"(, "step") --> will be picked for each request from this range
# - textual parameter: as list with unique options --> will be randomly picked for each from this list
# - coordinate parameter: like numeric, only that it specifies the amount of coordinates to produce
# - custom parameters: have to be registered in code, e.g. isochrone range, directions options.avoid_countries etc

# :param distance (optional): is the min/max (crow-flight) distance for a waypoint from the previous waypoint in degrees
# Be careful here. If it's too restrictive, it won't find suitable coordinates
distance:
  min: 0.5 # 1 degree ~= 60-110 km up to 50° N/S
  max: 1 # 1 degree ~= 60-110 km up to 50° N/S
